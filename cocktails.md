## Dry martini

- 2 dashes of french dry vermouth
- 30 ml london dry gin or vodka
- pitted spanish cocktail olive, no pimiento, chilled, for garnish
- lemon twist, for garnish

Fill a mixing glass—and I mean a glass, because a martini should
always be mixed in plain sight of the whole room—with ice. Add the
dashes of vermouth first, then the gin or vodka. Stir 50 times if using
large, dense, cold ice cubes, 30 times if using small, warmer cubes.
(We want water in the drink from the melting ice; it is a critical
ingredient that softens the alcohol jolt on the palate.) Strain into a
chilled cocktail glass. Garnish traditionally with the pitted olive, and
then twist a lemon peel over the top and drop it into the drink.

simple syrup; if using the ginger syrup, just place it in the bottom of
the bar glass. Either way, muddle the resulting ginger-sugar mixture
with the lime quarters, lychees, and velvet falernum. Add the vodka
and cracked ice, shake well, and then pour the contents of the shaker
—without straining—into a rocks glass.
